Method 1.

* Should you do this recursively? Or iteratively? (2 pts)

* Why? (5 pts)

* What edge cases should you consider? (3 pts)

* If there were 1000 moose today, how long ago did the first moose arrive(3 pts)

Method 2
* Should you do this recursively? Or iteratively? (2 pts)

* Why? (5 pts)

* What edge cases should you consider? (3 pts)

* If there are at least 1000 moose today, how long ago did the first 12 moose arrive(3 pts)



Method 3

* Should you do this recursively? Or iteratively? (2 pts)

* Why? (5 pts)

* What edge cases should you consider? (3 pts)

* If you start with 180 moose and 10 wolves, what is the moose population in 50 years(3 pts)?


Method 4
* Should you do this recursively? Or iteratively? (5 pts)

* Why? (5 pts)

* What edge cases should you consider? (5 pts)

* How many Moose should you start with if you begin with 5 wolves and want to
  reach a population of 500 moose and 25 wolves at some point within the next 50 years?
